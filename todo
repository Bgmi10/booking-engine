● 📋 Bulk Override History Feature - Implementation Plan

  Task 1: Design Database Schema

  What you need to do:
  - Create a new database table called bulk_override_logs or similar
  - Fields to include:
    - id (primary key)
    - user_id (who performed the action)
    - rate_policy_id (which rate policy was affected)
    - action_type (e.g., "BULK_OVERRIDE", "BULK_INCREASE", "BULK_DECREASE")
    - date_range_start (start date of the override)
    - date_range_end (end date of the override)
    - rooms_affected (JSON array of room IDs)
    - override_details (JSON with old prices, new prices, percentage changes, etc.)
    - total_rooms_affected (count)
    - total_dates_affected (count)
    - created_at (timestamp)
    - notes (optional user notes)

  Task 2: Backend API Endpoints

  What you need to create:
  - POST /admin/rate-policies/bulk-override-logs - Log a new bulk override action
  - GET /admin/rate-policies/bulk-override-logs - Retrieve history with filtering
  - GET /admin/rate-policies/bulk-override-logs/:id - Get specific log details
  - Add query parameters for filtering (date range, user, rate policy, action type)

  Task 3: Update BulkOverrideModal

  What you need to modify:
  - In the success callback after bulk override is applied
  - Call the logging API to record the action
  - Include all relevant details (rooms affected, date range, price changes)
  - Show success message confirming both the override AND that it was logged

  Task 4: Create BulkOverrideHistory Component

  What you need to build:
  - Table view showing: Date, User, Action Type, Rate Policy, Rooms Affected, Date Range
  - Expandable rows to show detailed changes
  - Modal or detailed view for complete override information
  - Pagination for large datasets

  Task 5: Add Navigation/Access

  Where to add access:
  - Add "View History" button in the RatePricingCalendar component
  - Or add a new tab/section in the rate policy management area
  - Consider adding it to the main admin navigation if it becomes frequently used

  Task 6: Filtering & Search

  Features to implement:
  - Filter by date range (when the override was performed)
  - Filter by user who performed the action
  - Filter by rate policy
  - Filter by action type
  - Search by room names or notes

  Task 7: Export Functionality

  Export options:
  - CSV export of bulk override history
  - Include all details in a readable format
  - Date range filtering for exports

  Task 8: Testing

  Test scenarios:
  - Perform various bulk overrides and verify they're logged correctly
  - Test filtering and search functionality
  - Verify export works properly
  - Test with multiple users and rate policies

  🔧 Technical Considerations

  Data Structure Example for override_details:
  {
    "action": "BULK_OVERRIDE",
    "changes": [
      {
        "room_id": "123",
        "room_name": "Deluxe Room",
        "dates_affected": ["2024-08-15", "2024-08-16"],
        "old_prices": [150.00, 160.00],
        "new_prices": [180.00, 190.00]
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_price_changes": 48,
      "average_increase_percentage": 20.5
    }
  }

  This feature will give your client complete visibility into pricing changes, which is excellent for business intelligence and compliance. Start with Task 1 (database
   schema) as everything else depends on it!
