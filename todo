Looking at your schema and the flow diagram, I can see you're building a hotel booking system with flexible payment and cancellation policies. Let me break down your 30%/70% payment split challenge and provide a solution.
Current Understanding
Your current flow:

User selects room
Pays 100% via Stripe
Booking confirmed

Your client wants:

User selects room
Pays 30% now via Stripe
Pays remaining 70% on check-in
Flexible policy creation based on 4 constraints

Solution for 30%/70% Payment Split
Stripe can handle this, but you'll need to manage the flow on your side. Here's how:
1. Database Schema Updates
First, let's extend your existing schema to handle split payments:Enhanced Schema for Split PaymentsCode // Add to your existing schema

model RatePolicy {
  id                  String   @id @default(uuid())
  name                String
  description         String
  nightlyRate         Float?
  discountPercentage  Float?
  isActive            Boolean  2. Implementation Strategy
Here's how to handle the 30%/70% split with Stripe:
Option 1: Two Separate Payment Intents (Recommended)
typescript// First payment (30%)
const firstPayment = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: Math.round(totalAmount * 0.30 * 100), // 30% in cents
  currency: 'eur',
  metadata: {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    payment_type: 'FIRST_INSTALLMENT'
  }
});

// Create second payment intent for later (70%)
const secondPayment = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: Math.round(totalAmount * 0.70 * 100), // 70% in cents
  currency: 'eur',
  metadata: {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    payment_type: 'SECOND_INSTALLMENT'
  },
  // Don't capture immediately, just authorize
  capture_method: 'manual'
});
Option 2: Stripe Payment Links for Remaining Amount
typescript// Create payment link for 70% that can be sent later
const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
  line_items: [{
    price_data: {
      currency: 'eur',
      product_data: {
        name: `Remaining Payment for Booking ${bookingId}`,
      },
      unit_amount: Math.round(remainingAmount * 100),
    },
    quantity: 1,
  }],
  metadata: {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    payment_type: 'SECOND_INSTALLMENT'
  }
});
3. Business Logic ImplementationBooking Flow Logic for Split PaymentsCode // booking-service.ts

interface BookingRequest {
  roomId: string;
  checkIn: Date;
  checkOut: Date;
  customerId: string;
  ratePolicyId: string;
  totalGuests: number;
}

interface PaymentCalculation {
  totalAmount: number;
  prepaidAmount: numb4. Key Implementation Points

Stripe Capabilities: Stripe can handle split payments through:

Multiple Payment Intents
Payment Links for deferred payments
Webhooks for payment tracking


Your 4 Policy Constraints: Based on your diagram, create these as enums:

FLEXIBLE (cancel anytime)
MODERATE (cancel up to 30 days)
STRICT (no cancel, but change up to 30 days)
NON_REFUNDABLE (no cancel, no change)


Payment Flow:

User selects room + policy
System calculates 30%/70% split
First payment (30%) processed immediately
Second payment link created for check-in
Automated reminders sent before check-in


Database Tracking: Your schema will track:

Total amount vs prepaid amount
Payment structure type
Remaining payment due date
Individual payment records



5. Benefits of This Approach

Flexible: Works with your 4 policy constraints
Scalable: Easy to add new payment structures
Stripe-native: Uses Stripe's built-in features
Automated: Handles reminders and tracking
Audit-friendly: Complete payment history

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part or help you implement the webhook handling for payment confirmations?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Hso, with this we can able to mix and match and create a single rate policy right that would be applied to our rooms rightEditExactly! Yes, with this approach you can create flexible rate policies that mix and match different payment structures and cancellation policies, then apply them to specific rooms. Let me show you how this works:Rate Policy Management SystemCode // rate-policy-service.ts

interface RatePolicyConfig {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  nightlyRate: number;
  discountPercentage?: number;
  
  // Payment Configuration
  paymentStructure: 'FULL_PAYMENT' | 'SPLIT_PAYMENT';
  prepayPercentagNow let me show you how this looks in practice with a room selection interface:Room Booking Example with Mixed Rate PoliciesCode // Example: How a room would show multiple rate options

interface RoomWithRatePolicies {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  basePrice: number;
  ratePolicies: RatePolicyOption[];
}

interface RatePolicyOption {
  id: string;
  naSummary: Yes, Perfect Mix & Match System!
Here's what you get with this approach:
1. Flexible Rate Policy Creation

Payment Structure: Full payment OR Split payment (30%/70%)
Cancellation Policy: Flexible, Moderate, Strict, or Non-refundable
Pricing: Base rate + discount percentage
Any combination possible

2. Room Assignment

One room can have multiple rate policies
Each policy offers different pricing/terms
Customer chooses their preferred option
Easy to manage via RoomRate junction table

3. Real-world Examples
Room: "Deluxe Ocean View"
├── Best Price (€80/night) - Full payment + Non-refundable
├── Early Bird (€100/night) - Split payment + Strict  
├── Advance Purchase (€120/night) - Split payment + Moderate
└── Flexible (€150/night) - Full payment + Flexible
4. Benefits

✅ Stripe-compatible - Uses native Stripe features
✅ Scalable - Easy to add new combinations
✅ User-friendly - Clear options for customers
✅ Admin-friendly - Simple policy management
✅ Automated - Handles payment reminders
✅ Audit-ready - Complete payment tracking

5. Your 4 Constraints Handled

Cancel anytime → FLEXIBLE policy
Cancel up to 30 days → MODERATE policy
No cancel, but change up to 30 days → STRICT policy
No cancel, no change → NON_REFUNDABLE policy

This gives you the flexibility to create any combination while keeping the system manageable and Stripe-compatible. Would you like me to help you implement the admin interface for creating these policies? // Add to your existing schema

} this is our expected features on admin side we should have to fix this. we have a already a basic setup as you can see here  @ratepolicies  here is the crud and other operations exist and user facing app just have a subscribe and go with a flow while checkout and here is how we apply to rooms for that you can take a look at here @room  here is the logic of applying policies but this a basic wire up now we need some advance things like i described above and we need to support the operations with stripe for. i will explain the current flow also  this is our expected flow of the user. but i have no idea of this flow. but i have a general flow of what i have currently. we are buliding the hotel bookings where we use a admin portal to manage the simple policies and discount policies and also we use stripe for payment now the current flow was user can check the rooms and pay 100 % one shot at stripe and we issue hte bookings details and confirm the booking. this is our current flow. but my client wants to add up another feature called pay 30% now rest 70% on check in which is where im confused will the stripe offer this kind of feature or we have to manage this on our side.  and this is feature we have to figure out because my client want  to flexible policy creation which is un detectable because if we know if they click this and then we prebuild the feature on stripe and flows goes smooth. but if we dont what will the policy then it would be issue for our self to pre build the payment pack, so, we will strict to four contraints and then we are sorted . now we have  figure out how we are going to handle the 30% and 70% this is where are currently i willl share the current schema of our system i guesst that would hlep you to understand our standards. let me know you thoughts on this and make a to do list then we will go from there
