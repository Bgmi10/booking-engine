⚛️ 4. Frontend Development
General Setup
 React Router setup with pages:

/ → Home (room list)

/book/:roomId → Booking form

/confirm → Confirmation page

/admin/login → Admin login

/admin/dashboard → Dashboard

Public Booking Flow
 Home page: list rooms with “Book” button

 Booking Form:

Inputs: guest name, email, check-in/out dates

Submit: check availability → create hold → redirect to Stripe

 Confirmation page (after Stripe success)

Parse session_id, show booking confirmation

Admin Dashboard
 Admin login → store JWT

 Authenticated dashboard:

View, create, update, delete rooms

View bookings

🧪 5. Validation & Error Handling
 Use Zod on backend for all request schema validation

 Global error handler middleware

 Gracefully handle:

Room not available

Expired holds

Stripe payment failure

🧼 6. Cleanup & Expired Hold Handling
 Option A: cron job every 5 mins to delete expired TemporaryHolds

 Option B: On every new hold or availability check, auto-delete expired ones
